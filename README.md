# Common files used across analyses for VRd TEA-seq data

These files include sample metadata, gene sets, and color sets used for analysis and figure generation.

This repository is imported as a submodule for the main [VRd TEA-seq analysis repository](https://github.com/aifimmunology/repro-vrd-tea-seq).

This separate repository enables quick access to these common files by cloning this subdirectory in our HISE analysis environment.
